          The sketchbook is a shared space where you can draw on the pages. You
          can lock the sketchbook to prevent others from drawing on the pages.
          You can also unlock the sketchbook to allow others to draw on the
          pages. The sketchbook will automatically unlock after 60 minutes.

          Everything is completely anonymous. No personal data is stored. If you
          want to mark your name on the sketchbook though, you are free to do so
          at your own risk.

        <p>
          I have the ability to edit what is in the sketchbook, so please keep
          it respectful. I will be monitoring the sketchbook to ensure that it
          is a safe and fun place for everyone.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          There are only 10 pages available in the sketchbook. I am happy to add
          more pages if there is interest.
